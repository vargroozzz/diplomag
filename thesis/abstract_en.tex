This master's thesis focuses on the design and development of a full-stack web application named \textit{Beekeepers Community Platform} â€” an integrated platform designed for the Ukrainian beekeeping community to facilitate effective communication, specialized knowledge exchange, and provide tools for apiary and field management.

The work includes an analysis of the subject area, a review of existing solutions for communities, and a justification for the chosen technology stack, which includes React for the frontend, NestJS for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.

The platform architecture was designed, and functional and non-functional requirements were defined. Key modules have been developed, such as a forum for discussions, a knowledge base, an interactive map for managing apiaries and fields, and a user authentication mechanism with email verification and Google Sign-In capability.

The development process, code structure, API design principles, and main components of the beekeepers community platform are described. Security considerations were addressed, and appropriate mechanisms were implemented.

Testing of the main functional capabilities of the application was conducted. Based on the results, conclusions were formulated, and directions for further platform development were outlined.

\textbf{Keywords:} web application, beekeepers community, React, NestJS, MongoDB, forum, knowledge base, interactive map, authentication, OAuth.
